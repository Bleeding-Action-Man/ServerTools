[b]Completely reworked[/b]

- Option to start a 'Skip Trader' vote collection
- Option to change default trader time for whole match
- Option to change current trader time for current trader
- Option to give only selected players access permission to the manipulate trader time (Voting is allowed for all, tho)

[b]Completely new[/b]

- Option for players to revive themselves by paying a Dosh fee
- Option for players to revive their teammates by paying a Dosh fee

- New 'ESC-MENU' tab for trader manipulation + revival options
- Global notifications to improve user experience
